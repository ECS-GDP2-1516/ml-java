/** 
 * An abstract class for instance filters: objects that take instances
 * as input, carry out some transformation on the instance and then
 * output the instance. The method implementations in this class
 * assume that most of the work will be done in the methods overridden
 * by subclasses.<p>
 *
 * A simple example of filter use. This example doesn't remove
 * instances from the output queue until all instances have been
 * input, so has higher memory consumption than an approach that
 * uses output instances as they are made available:<p>
 *
 * <code> <pre>
 *  Filter filter = ..some type of filter..
 *  Instances instances = ..some instances..
 *  for (int i = 0; i < data.numInstances(); i++) {
 *    filter.input(data.instance(i));
 *  }
 *  filter.batchFinished();
 *  Instances newData = filter.outputFormat();
 *  Instance processed;
 *  while ((processed = filter.output()) != null) {
 *    newData.add(processed);
 *  }
 *  ..do something with newData..
 * </pre> </code>
